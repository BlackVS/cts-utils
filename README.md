# CTS Utils

There is some my scripts which I used during Capture the Signal CTF:
[CTS Ninja](https://cts.ninja/)

Main reason - cts-tools supports only GNU Radio 3.7 and proposed VM are based on outdated Ubuntu 18.04 and GNU Radio 3.7 ^(

During CTF I'm also ported cts-tools to latest GNU Radio 3.8.2 / Ubuntu 21.04

This utils tested on:
- Ubuntu 21.04
- GNU Radio 3.8.2
